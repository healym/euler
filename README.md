# Euler Problems

This is where I plan on housing my solutions to problems listed on Project
Euler. My solutions will be written in Haskell, as an excersice to further
my knowledge of and familiarity with it.

## What are the Euler Problems?

The Euler Problems are problems of the set described in Project Euler.
I understand that my naming convention is wrong, but most people tend to
refer to them as "the Project Euler Problems," which seems a bit long to
me, so I dropped the "Project" for this use.

## Where can I find these magical problems?

[projecteuler.net](http://projecteuler.net/)

c'mon, I know you can google things.
